**Classical ciphers encryption and decryption**
* The program supports encryption and decryption using shift, affine, and
vigenere ciphers.
* It should be callable from command line as follows:
    * The first argument is the cipher type ["shift", "affine", "vigenere"].
    * The second argument is the operation type ["enc", "dec"].
    * The third argument is the input file.
    * The fourth argument is the output file.
    * The last argument is the the list of encryption keys required for the cipher.
